/*
 * If you want to model groups of similar data, collections are your solution.
 * A collection contains a group of elements.
 * There are many types of collection in Dart, but the most common are:
 * 
 * Lists: Linear collections where the order of the lements is maintained.
 *  List equivalent in other languages:
 *  ArrayList (Java)
 *  Array (JavaScript)
 *  Array (Swift)
 * 
 * Maps: Non-linear collections of values that can be accessed by a unique key.
 *  Map equivalent in other languages:
 *  HashMap (Java)
 *  Object (JavaScript)
 *  Dictionary (Swift)
 * 
 * Sets: Non-linear collections of unique values where the order is not maintained.
 *  Set equivalent in other languages:
 *  HashSet (Java)
 *  Set (JavaScript)
 *  Set (Swift)
 * 
 * One thing these collections have in common is subscript syntax.
 * Subscripts are a way to quickly access elements in a collection, and they tend to work identically from language to language:
 * numbers[1] = 15; 
 * The preceding line assigns the second value in the numbers list to 15.

/*
This function shows how to declare, add, and remove data from a list.
Sometimes, it is safer to use the first and last accessors on the list instead of accessing the element directly:
final firstElement = numbers.first;
final lastElement = numbers.last;
Note that if your set is empty, first and last will throw an exception as well

/*
Maps store two points of data per element â€“ a key and a value.
Keys are used to write and retrieve the values stored in the list.
Unlike arrays, if you try to access a value with a key that is not on the map, then it will just gracefully fail and return null. It will not throw an exception.

/*
Sets are the least common collection type, but still very useful.
They are used to store values where the order is not important and duplicates are not allowed.
Since sets require elements to be unique and they don't have to maintain an explicit order, they can be significantly faster than lists.

/*
You can include if statements, for loops, and spread operators directly inside your collection declarations.
These operators work mostly like their normal control flow counterparts, except you do not add brackets and you only get a single line to yield a new value in the collection.
However, the single line requirement can be very restrictive, so Dart has also borrowed the spread operator from JavaScript.
By putting the three dots before the sublist, Dart will unbox the second list and flatten all these numbers into a single list.
You can use this technique to add more than one value inside a collection-if or collection-for statement.
Spread operators can also be used anywhere you wish to merge lists; they are not limited to collection-if and collection-for.
We will be using this style of syntax extensively when we get to Flutter.
