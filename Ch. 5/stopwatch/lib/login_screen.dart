      WidgetBuilder is a function that provides a BuildContext and expects a Widget to be returned:
      builder: (_) => StopWatch(name: name, email: email)
      This allows Flutter to delay the construction of the widget until it's needed.
      We also didn't need the context property, so it was replaced with an underscore.
