StatefulWidgets are made up of two classes: the widget and the state.
The widget part of StatefulWidget really doesn't do much, and all the properties that you store in it must be final; otherwise, you will get a compile error.
The State object takes over the build responsibilities from the widget.
States can also be marked as dirty, which is what will cause them to repaint on the next frame.

The State class has a life cycle.
Unlike StatelessWidget, which is nothing more than a build method, StatefulWidgets have a few different life cycle methods that are called in a specific order.

initState
didChangeDependencies
didUpdateWidget
build (required)
reassemble
deactivate
dispose
