/*
 * Flutter has a powerful and fast text engine that can render all the rich text that you'd expect from a modern mobile framework.
 * In this recipe, we will be drawing text with Flutter's two primary widgets â€“ Text and RichText.
 * The Text widget is the most common way to quickly print text on the screen, but you will also occasionally need RichText when you want to add even more style within a single line.
 * The Text widget has some basic properties that warrant discussion, such as text alignment and setting a maximum number of lines, but the real meat is in the TextStyle object.
 * There are several properties in TextStyles that are exhaustively covered in the official documentation, but you will most frequently be adjusting the font size, color, weight, and font.
 * As a bonus, Text widgets are accessibility-aware out of the box. There is no extra code that you'll need to write.
 * Text widgets respond to the text to speech synthesizers and will even scale their font size up and down if the user decides to adjust the system's font size.
